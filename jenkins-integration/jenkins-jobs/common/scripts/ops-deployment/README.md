DELETE ME!!!!!!!!!!

This directory contains some one-off scripts that were being
used to help set up the specific scenario we were going to try
to test for the ops environment.  A lot of this is obselete,
and the rest ought to be refactored into more re-usable code in
the pipeline.groovy and job-steps scripts.  For now, though,
these hacks are still being referenced in a few places.
