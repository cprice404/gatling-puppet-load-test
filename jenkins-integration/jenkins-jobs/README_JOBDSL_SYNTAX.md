## gatling-puppet-load-test `JobDSL.groovy` syntax

In each scenario directory where you have created a `Jenkinsfile` to define a
gatling-puppet-load-test perf testing job, you may optionally also create a file
named `JobDSL.groovy`.  If such a file is found, the seed job will use it to
configure additional metadata about the job.

If this doesn't make sense yet, make sure you've read the [main README.md](./README.md)
about defining perf testing jobs, and the [Jenkinsfile README.md](./README_JENKINSFILE_SYNTAX.md)
about what the `Jenkinsfile`s look like.

Basically, the `Jenkinsfile` is used to define what happens once a job is
launched, and the `JobDSL.groovy` file (optionally) configures metadata about the
job before it is launched.  Examples might be:

* modifying the number of runs to retain in the build history for a job
* scheduling the job to automatically run at a certain time interval

The `JobDSL.groovy` file should just be a plain-old groovy script (no need to
define any classes or functions, though you should be able to define functions
for your own use if you like).  It uses the [Jenkins JobDSL plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki).
There is some [pretty solid API documentation for this DSL](https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/)
available if you're not sure how to modify some type of job configuration that
you are interested in.  (It's worth calling out again that the JobDSL DSL/API
is completely distinct from the Jenkins Pipeline DSL that is used in the
`Jenkinsfile`.)

When the script is run, it will be executed with
a binding context that makes two variables available in it's local scope:

* `out`: this is the [JobDSL logging stream](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Job-DSL-Commands#logging).
  Basically, you can call `println` on this object to have log messages show up
  in the Jenkins console output when the seed job (`refresh-gplt-jobs`) is run.
* `job`: this variable will contain a reference to
  [the actual job definition](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Job-DSL-Commands#job)
  that the seed job is building up.  To make changes to the job,
